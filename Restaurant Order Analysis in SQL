# Restaurant Orders and Menu Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a restaurant's menu and order data using SQL queries. The analysis is divided into three sections:
1. **Menu Items Analysis** - Examining menu structure, pricing, and categorization.
2. **Order Details Analysis** - Understanding order volume, frequency, and high-volume orders.
3. **Menu & Order Details Combination** - Integrating menu data with order records to extract business insights.

---
## 📂 Datasets Used
The project uses three tables:
1. **menu_items**: Contains information about dishes, their prices, and categories.
2. **order_details**: Records details of customer orders.
3. **menu_items JOIN order_details**: A combined dataset for deeper analysis.

## 🔍 SQL Queries & Objectives

### **1️⃣ Menu Items Analysis**
**Objectives:**
- View all menu items.
- Count the number of menu items.
- Identify the least and most expensive dishes.
- Analyze Italian dishes.
- Count dishes per category.
- Determine the average price per category.

**Key Queries:**
```sql
-- View the menu_items table
SELECT * FROM menu_items;

-- Count the number of items on the menu
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items;

-- Find the least and most expensive items
SELECT * FROM menu_items ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Count Italian dishes
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menu_items WHERE category='Italian';

-- Least and most expensive Italian dishes
SELECT * FROM menu_items WHERE category='Italian' ORDER BY price DESC;

-- Count dishes per category
SELECT category, COUNT(menu_item_id) AS num_dishes FROM menu_items GROUP BY category;

-- Average price per category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM menu_items GROUP BY category;
```

### **2️⃣ Order Details Analysis**
**Objectives:**
- View order details.
- Determine the date range.
- Count the number of orders and items.
- Identify orders with the most items.
- Find orders exceeding 12 items.

**Key Queries:**
```sql
-- View the order_details table
SELECT * FROM order_details;

-- Find date range of orders
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date) FROM order_details;

-- Count total orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM order_details;

-- Count total items ordered
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_details;

-- Identify orders with the most items
SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items FROM order_details GROUP BY order_id ORDER BY num_items DESC;

-- Count orders with more than 12 items
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
    SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
    FROM order_details
    GROUP BY order_id
    HAVING num_items > 12
) AS num_orders;
```

### **3️⃣ Menu & Order Details Combination**
**Objectives:**
- Join `menu_items` with `order_details` for comprehensive analysis.
- Identify the most and least ordered items.
- Find the highest-spending orders.
- Examine category details of top orders.

**Key Queries:**
```sql
-- Join menu_items with order_details
SELECT * FROM order_details od LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;

-- Find the least and most ordered items
SELECT item_name, category, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name, category
ORDER BY num_purchases DESC;

-- Find the top 5 highest spending orders
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- View category breakdown for the highest spend order (Order ID: 440)
SELECT category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440
GROUP BY category;

-- Analyze top 5 highest spending orders
SELECT order_id, category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440, 2075, 1957, 330, 2675)
GROUP BY order_id, category;
```

## 🏆 Key Insights
1. The restaurant offers a variety of dishes, with Italian cuisine making up a significant portion.
2. Price variations exist across categories, with some dishes being significantly more expensive than others.
3. High-volume orders indicate peak demand periods and preferred menu items.
4. The most frequently ordered items belong to certain categories, which could help in menu optimization.
5. The highest-spending orders provide insights into customer preferences and potential upselling opportunities.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Perform trend analysis on order frequency by date.
- Identify seasonal demand for specific dishes.
- Suggest menu adjustments based on customer preferences.
- Optimize pricing strategy using the average price per category.
