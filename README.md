  - Death rate per infection
  - Infection rate per population
  - Rolling vaccination totals
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:**
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Temporary tables
  - Window functions
  - Joins and aggregations
- **Data Visualization Preparation:**
  - Generated datasets ready for visualization to illustrate trends and insights.
